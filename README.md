# Data-Analysis-with-Snowflake-and-Pandas-Using-Advanced-Date-and-Time-Functions-
🎯 Objective: 
To practice retrieving data from Snowflake, performing advanced manipulations with Pandas, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), with a focus on date/time analysis and insight generation.
🛠 Key Tasks:
1️⃣ Data Setup
🔹 Retrieved datasets from Snowflake: Orders, Customers, Products, and OrderDetails.
🔹 Loaded the data into Pandas DataFrames for manipulation.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
🔹 Checked for duplicate rows and handled missing values.
🔹 Replaced missing numeric values with the column mean and categorical values with the mode.

3️⃣ Data Joining
🔹 Performed multiple joins to create a comprehensive dataset with orders, customer details, products, and line items.

4️⃣ Date & Time Analysis
🔹 Converted and extracted key insights like Year, Month, and Day of the Week.
🔹 Created metrics like days_since_order to track order recency.
🔹 Grouped data by Year and Month to calculate total and average revenue.

5️⃣ Advanced Aggregations
🔹 Found top customers by revenue, total orders by region, and category-wise performance.
🔹 Analyzed monthly revenue trends for each product to identify declining sales.

6️⃣ Advanced Timedelta Analysis
🔹 Simulated delivery dates by adding 5 days to the order date.
🔹 Identified late deliveries based on a threshold.
🔹 Calculated average time between orders for each customer.

7️⃣ Visualizations
🔹 Created trend charts and revenue breakdowns to make the insights actionable and intuitive.
